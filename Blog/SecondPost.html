					Day 2 - Initial excitement over, I was pretty bummed to realize that perhaps Github Pages would be too limited for me. 
					I loved the simplicity - signing up and getting started but quickly realized that Github Pages is not a full fledged 
					web server. That's okay but I just have to realize that I can't have fun toys like a template with 
					header/sidebar/footer since it appears I would probably need to use php and Github Pages doesn't execute php files.
					I have to think this through a little bit and I think I'll stick with Github Pages for the interim, especially since
					learning on a limited platform may actually be beneficial to me anyways.
				</p>

				<br>
				<p>
					However, I still think I have a good start. Things I've learned/implemented thus far:
					<br>
						<ul>
							<li>My LinkedIn and Instagram images and URLs are now located in the header</li>
							<li>Implemented a font - a free one called Montserrat.</li>
							<li>I think my first goal is to get the blog going (so I can keep track of my progress)</li>
							<li>Trying to settle on how wide the div holding my content should be and how best to center that div</li>
							<li>Also started planning out other parts of the site including: travel and projects.</li>
							<li>Thinking about some kind of logo as well.</li>
						</ul>
					<br>
					That's the update!
